The following code is adapted from the apa6 documentclass. Most of it is copied verbatim except for
a few name changes to avoid potential document class clashes. It does not do anonymization.
The following commands have been renamed: (along with their internal versions):

\author -> \APAauthor
\title -> \APAtitle
\shorttitle -> \APAshorttitle
\maketitle -> \APAmaketitle
\abstract -> \APAabstract
\keywords -> \APAkeywords
\authornote -> \APAauthornote
\note -> \APAnote

The following commands have been added:

\APAtitleformat -> defaults to \LARGE
\APAauthformat -> defaults to \large
\APAaffilformat -> defaults to {}

Use \renewcommand to change these formats as needed


All other author/affiliation commands remain the same as in the apa6 class
Please refer to the documentation of the class for how to use them.
